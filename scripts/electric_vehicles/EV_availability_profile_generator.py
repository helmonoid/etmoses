#==============================================================================
# This script generates 33 different EV availability profiles for 11 different 
# drivers and 3 different charging powers. We assume that each driver uses his 
# car to commute to work on workdays and to go to other activities on both 
# weekend days. The commute to work follows the same pattern every workday
# (i.e. the same departure and arrival times and distance travelled). In order 
# to avoid the charging to start on exactly the same time every workday, we add
# a random time to the departure and arrival times in the interval [-30, 30]
# minutes. We do the same for weekend days. For weekend days we pick a random
# trip from the other data. Both the work and othe data come from table D.1 in
# the thesis of Remco Verzijlbergh. Finally we take into account (public) 
# holidays and sick leave by assuming that the EV stays at home for about 18% 
# of the work days, selected randomly.
#
# The availability profiles are used to determine the absolute minimum charge
# that needs to be present in the car battery to have enough "fuel" to run the
# next trip. The remaining battery volume could be used to store electricity 
# (and use it later). From the required charge for the next trip and the 
# charging rate, we calculate when the car has to start charging.
#
# The availability is expressed as a percentage of the battery volume.
