    # OptionalBuffers are a hybrid consumption/storage technology. A profile is
    # used to define the energy consumed, but it may also store excess energy
    # from the network for later use.
    #
    # If the buffer has insufficient energy stored to meet the demand defined by
    # the profile, the deficit goes unmet. Buffers do not take energy from the
    # grid. Energy stored in the buffer may only be used to satisfy its own
    # consumption, and is not released back to the network.
